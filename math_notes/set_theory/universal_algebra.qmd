## Universal Algebra

We denote the nullary set $G^0$ as $\{ \emptyset \}$.

::: {#def-Structure}
## Structure
A structure is set equipped with finary operations.
:::

::: {#def-FinaryOperation}
## Finary Operation
A finary operation is a map from a set $G$ to any of 
$$
G^0, G^1=G, G^2 = G \times G, ...
$$.
:::

::: {#def-OperationalType}
## Operational Type
An operational type is a pair $(\Omega, \alpha)$ with

- set of operation symbols $\Omega$ 
- a map $\alpha : \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{N}$ that assigns each $\omega \in \Omega$ it's arity $\alpha(\omega)$.
:::

::: {#def-OperationalStructure}
## Operational Structure
An operational structure $(\Omega, \alpha)$ is 

- a set $A$ with an operational type $(\Omega, \alpha)$ 

-  a function $\omega_A : A^{\alpha(\omega)} \mapsto A$ for each $\omega \in \Omega$

$\omega_A$ is *the interpretation of abstract symbol* $\omega$ *in the structure $A$*.
