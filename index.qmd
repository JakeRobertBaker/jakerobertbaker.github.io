### PyMC Prophet
Reimplementing Prophet linear model with PyMC to add some extra pieces like hierachical prior on changepoints, changepoints in seasonality.

### Ballots + Bayes
Current work in progress.
Use of nice conjugate prior to get a  nice [posterior](/math_notes/bayesian_inference/ballot_notes.qmd) of an election result given a sample.

### Linear Model Notes
Need to prove geometry of ANOVA and R2 to compare feature engineering method. The latter is [TODO](math_notes/linear_models/linear_models.qmd).
